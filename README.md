- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpjordan
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Python, with a little bit of html scattered here and there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a human-computer interaction project aimed at helping users with special needs. I'd also like to dip my toes into the waters of cyber security and cyphers to see if that's something I want to do as a career. But as I'm still somewhat fresh in this field, I'd like to partner up to work on a simple game or something fun ... just for some fun practice in programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: mpruner@augusta.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I rode my bicycle across South Korea in one day.
